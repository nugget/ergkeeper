			ErgKeeper is a free web-portal which can be used to upload workout information
			from your PM4-equpped <a href="http://www.concept2.com/">Concept2</a> rowing
			machine to your account on <a href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a>.
			That's all the site does.
		</p>
		<p>
			This site is brand-new and in beta testing currently.  There are certainly
			many bugs left to find and many features which are not implemented yet.
			It is fully-functional from end-to-end, though, and you're welcome to
			give it a shot.
