Stuff that still has to be done
===============================

* Allow user to update users.logfile_username in chooser
* Add facebook/twitter posting preferences
* Figure out how to set equipment type via Health Graph API
* Upload page cosmetics
* Chooser "select all" convenience control
* Auto-import on upload to bypass chooser
* Write a script to auto-upload/choose/post to bypass web entirely
